Hello guys this is the flask mvc project structure we are going to be using. 

## First initialization 
 > To initialize the project firstly you have to create a virtual environment by running the following commands in your terminal

    python -m venv .venv

> And then activate your environment
> In Bash

    source .venv/Scripts/activate

> In PowerShell

    .venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1

> In CMD

    .venv/Scripts/activate.bat

> Afterwards run pip install to install libraries 

    pip install -r requirements.txt


> There after you can just run the app.py file to check if everything is working smoothly

    flask run --debug
