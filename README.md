Hello guys this is the flask mvc project structure we are going to be using. 

##First initialization
To initialize the project firstly you have to create a virtual environment by running the following commands in your terminal
'code' python -m venv 

And then activate your environment with 
'code'  source directory-to-your-environment/Scripts/activate

Afterwards run pip install to install libraries 
'code' pip install -r requirements.txt

There after you can just run the app.py file to check if everything is working smoothly
